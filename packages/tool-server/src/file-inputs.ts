/**
 * Server-side resolution of file-input wrappers — the INPUT half of the
 * remote file boundary (the OUTPUT half is `artifacts.ts`).
 *
 * The client replaces args declared in a tool's `fileInputs` with
 * {@link FileInputWire} wrappers (path + stat + optional base64 content). This
 * module turns each wrapper back into a plain server-readable string *before*
 * zod validation, so tools always execute against a local path:
 *
 * - co-located client (the common, unlinked case): the wrapper's path matches
 *   on this host's own filesystem and is used in place — zero copies, exactly
 *   mirroring the artifact materializer's gate on the client side.
 * - remote client: `kind: "file"` content is materialized into a temp file;
 *   `kind: "directory"` fails with remote-mode guidance (a tree can't ride in
 *   a tool call); `kind: "tar-upload"` is extracted from a streamed tar when
 *   `uploadId` is set (always, even if the path also exists on this host);
 *   `kind: "probe"` passes through and only reports presence.
 *
 * Plain string args (older clients, direct invocations) pass through untouched,
 * which is what keeps both halves of the version-skew matrix on today's
 * behavior.
