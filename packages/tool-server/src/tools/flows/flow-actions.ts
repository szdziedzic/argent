/**
 * Poll a condition against the flow tree until it holds or `timeoutMs` passes.
 * One engine behind both conditional directives — they differ only in budget
 * and intent:
 *
 * - `await` (action-length default timeout, overridable per step via
 *   `timeout:`) — a real wait for a transition. Evaluating it here, rather
 *   than delegating to the `await-ui-element` tool, gives it the same loose
 *   bare-string semantics (identifier-first, then text) and the same
 *   full-hierarchy tree source as every other selector directive; the raw
 *   `tool: await-ui-element` step remains the escape hatch for custom
 *   poll/bundleId.
 * - `assert` (short grace window, {@link DEFAULT_ASSERT_TIMEOUT_MS}) — a
 *   correctness check that only absorbs the latency of an update landing a
 *   frame after an action; a genuinely-false assertion still fails quickly.
 *
 * Mirrors `await-ui-element`'s blind-read guard: an EMPTY tree is not
 * trustworthy evidence for `hidden` (the only condition an empty tree
 * satisfies) when the adapter flagged the read as degraded or the selector had
 * matched on an earlier poll — a transient blank frame mid-navigation must not
 * confirm the element left.

  //    selector had matched). A probe that never got a trustworthy look at
  //    the screen cannot vouch for "condition false" for ANY condition.
  // 2. Trusted reads existed but the window went dark at the end: the FINAL
  //    read attempt was blind or threw AND the last trusted read lies more
  //    than {@link CONDITION_DARK_TAIL_TOLERANCE_MS} behind the loop's exit.
  //    The condition becoming true is exactly the transition being waited on,
  //    so a "condition false" observation from before the reads went dark
  //    says nothing about the deadline — a determinate verdict built from it
  //    would let a dying tree source fake a clean report (and green-skip a
  //    `when:` guard whose dismissal target may well be on screen). `hidden`
  //    is held to a stricter bar: there "condition false" means the element
  //    was VISIBLE, and the element leaving is the transition itself — so ANY
  //    untrusted final read, however short the tail, leaves gone-ness
  //    unconfirmable.
  // 3. Dark tail within the tolerance — a genuine last-poll blip: trusted
  //    reads showed the condition false until at most ~one poll interval
  //    before the deadline, so they still describe the window and a transient
  //    fetch error on the trailing poll must not flip a clean skip into a
  //    hard error. The determinate verdict stands, with the failed final read
  //    appended so the error is not silently dropped from the report.
