  // Post-timeout verdict — unknown must not masquerade as false. Three tiers
  // of evidence quality:
  //
  // 1. No trusted read in the whole window: every fetch either threw or
  //    returned a blind tree (empty + degraded hint, or empty after the
  //    selector had matched). A probe that never got a trustworthy look at
  //    the screen cannot vouch for "condition false" for ANY condition.
  // 2. Trusted reads existed but the window went dark at the end: the FINAL
  //    read attempt was blind or threw AND the last trusted read lies more
  //    than {@link CONDITION_DARK_TAIL_TOLERANCE_MS} behind the loop's exit.
  //    The condition becoming true is exactly the transition being waited on,
  //    so a "condition false" observation from before the reads went dark
  //    says nothing about the deadline — a determinate verdict built from it
  //    would let a dying tree source fake a clean report (and green-skip a
  //    `when:` guard whose dismissal target may well be on screen). `hidden`
  //    is held to a stricter bar: there "condition false" means the element
  //    was VISIBLE, and the element leaving is the transition itself — so ANY
  //    untrusted final read, however short the tail, leaves gone-ness
  //    unconfirmable.
  // 3. Dark tail within the tolerance — a genuine last-poll blip: trusted
  //    reads showed the condition false until at most ~one poll interval
  //    before the deadline, so they still describe the window and a transient
  //    fetch error on the trailing poll must not flip a clean skip into a
  //    hard error. The determinate verdict stands, with the failed final read
  //    appended so the error is not silently dropped from the report.
