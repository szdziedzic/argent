Steps run in order: \`launch\` starts an app from scratch (terminate + relaunch) and waits until it is

element and act on it (\`tap: { on, times: 2 }\` double-taps; \`long-press: { on, duration }\` presses and
holds; \`type: { into, text, clear, submit }\` types into a field — \`clear: true\` empties it first, since
typing otherwise leaves the old value in place, the new text landing at the caret the focusing tap
set (spliced INTO the old value on Android, appended on iOS); \`text\` may be omitted for a
clear-only step, which sends no Enter unless \`submit: true\`;
\`tap\`/\`long-press\` alternatively take a raw normalized point — bare \`{ x, y }\` or \`on: { x, y }\`;
any selector may scope its matches geometrically, the CSS combinators read off frames: \`within: <selector>\`
(descendant — inside that container's frame), \`after: <selector>\` (CSS \`~\` — following it in reading
order), \`next: <selector>\` (CSS \`+\` — the nearest such follower, which unlike CSS reaches past a
non-matching neighbour rather than failing), plus \`any: true\` (CSS \`*\` — legal only WITH a scope and
never beside text/id/role). Scopes nest to disambiguate — \`within: { id: card, within: { id: list } }\`
reads "inside card inside list", each container's frame inside the next);
\`scroll-to\` scrolls (momentum-free) until a target is visible; \`pinch\` zooms
(\`pinch: { on?, scale }\` — scale > 1 in, < 1 out; screen center when \`on\` is omitted); \`rotate\` is the
two-finger rotation gesture (\`rotate: { on?, by }\` — degrees, + clockwise, within ±3000°; screen center
when \`on\` is omitted; distinct from the \`rotate\` tool, which changes device orientation); \`await\` waits
for a UI condition; \`wait\` pauses for a fixed number of milliseconds; \`assert\` checks one now; \`snapshot\`
diffs a screenshot — or, with \`cropOn: <selector>\`, one element's cropped region — against a stored
baseline (a missing baseline fails the step — set updateBaselines to adopt the current screen; a
cropped element whose size drifted fails on dimensions); \`echo\` annotates; \`run\` executes a referenced fragment inline.
A \`when:\` block (condition + \`steps:\`, no else) runs its steps only if the condition holds —
checked once with the short assert grace — for one-sided divergences like interstitials and coach
marks; a skipped block reports distinctly and failures inside an entered block are real failures.
A flow that begins with a \`launch\` step is a self-contained e2e flow; one that doesn't runs against the
device's current state. Device id is injected by the runner (flows store none) — pass \`device\` or
\`platform\` to pick one, else the single booted device is used. For a Chromium e2e flow the \`launch\`
step's chromium value is an Electron app path ({ chromium: <path> | { path, args } }); the runner boots a
fresh instance from it (on the tool-server host) and tears it down when the run ends, unless an explicit
\`device\` pins an already-running instance. Every step hard-stops the flow on failure;
later steps are reported as skipped. Returns a structured report ({ ok, passed, failed, skipped, errored, steps }).
