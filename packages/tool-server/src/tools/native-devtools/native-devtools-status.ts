  description: `Check whether native devtools are connected to a specific app and whether the next launch is prepared for injection.
Use when you need to verify native devtools readiness before calling native-full-hierarchy, native-describe-screen, or native-network-logs.

Returns { envSetup, appRunning, connected, requiresRestart, nextLaunchWillBeInjected, injectable }:
- envSetup: DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES is configured in the simulator's launchd environment
- appRunning: the target bundle currently has a running UIKit process on the simulator
- connected: the dylib is active in the current running process for this bundleId
- requiresRestart: the app is already running but its current process does not have native devtools injected (always false for a non-injectable app)
- nextLaunchWillBeInjected: if you launch this bundle now, native devtools env setup is already in place (always false for a non-injectable app)
- injectable: whether native devtools can ever be injected into this app. Apple system apps (bundle ids under com.apple.) are platform binaries with library validation, so the dylib can never load into them.

Call this before using app-scoped native hierarchy tools or native-network-logs.
If injectable is false: this is a TERMINAL state — the app can never be injected. Do NOT restart/retry. Use the standard \`describe\` tool (its accessibility path reads the screen without injection) to obtain coordinates for direct \`gesture-*\` calls, or use \`screenshot\` to inspect visual state only; never derive coordinates from a screenshot. Tree-gated flow directives — including raw-point \`tap\` and \`long-press\` — require the full flow hierarchy and are unavailable for this app; raw \`tool: gesture-*\` steps retain direct tool semantics. Do not fall back to the native-devtools feature tools (native-describe-screen, native-find-views, native-full-hierarchy, native-network-logs, native-view-at-point, native-user-interactable-view-at-point) — they run the same injection precheck and fail with the same non-injectable error.
If appRunning is false and nextLaunchWillBeInjected is true: use launch-app normally.
If requiresRestart is true: call restart-app, then proceed with the native feature.
Returns { status: "init_failed", message, attempts } instead when the simulator's native-devtools environment failed to initialize.
Fails if the simulator server is not running for the given UDID.`,
