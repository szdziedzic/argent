    description: `Type text or press special keys on the device (iOS simulator, Android emulator or device, Chromium app, Vega Virtual Device, or Apple TV / Android TV) using keyboard events.
Use when you need to enter text or trigger a named key such as enter, escape, or arrow keys. On Vega and Apple TV / Android TV, prefer the remote tools for D-pad navigation; use keyboard to type into a focused text field (e.g. a search or login box).
Returns { typed: string, keys: number, cleared?: boolean }. Fails if both text and key are given in one call (rejected before anything is typed), if an unsupported key name is provided, if \`clear\` is used on a platform that cannot do it, or if the device's input backend is not reachable.
- text: types a string (supports uppercase, digits, common punctuation). To type a credential, use \`{{secret:<NAME>}}\` — resolved server-side from the \`ARGENT_SECRET_<NAME>\` env var (prefix mandatory; \`{{secret:APP_PASSWORD}}\` ↔ \`ARGENT_SECRET_APP_PASSWORD\`), so the plaintext never enters agent context; the result echoes the placeholder, not the value, and the after-typing auto-screenshot is skipped. To submit after typing a secret, put both steps in ONE \`run-sequence\` — that keeps the skip covering the Enter, which a second bare \`keyboard\` call would not.
- key: presses a single named key (enter, escape, backspace, tab, arrow-up/down/left/right, f1–f12) — NOT supported on TV targets; move focus with \`tv-remote\` instead.
- clear: empties the focused field before typing. Typing alone does NOT replace — against a field that already holds a value (a remembered login, a restored draft, a re-run step) the old text stays and the new text goes in at the caret, landing after the old value or spliced into the middle of it depending on where focus left the caret (tapping a long value to focus it puts the caret where you tapped). Use \`{ clear: true, text: "…" }\` to replace a value, \`{ clear: true }\` alone to just empty it. iOS, Android and Chromium; rejected on Vega and TV targets. Focus a text field first — on Chromium a clear with nothing editable focused is refused outright, and on iOS/Android it is dispatched blind. Only Chromium reads the field back, and even there an unreadable page falls back to best-effort — so \`cleared: true\` never means "seen NOT empty", but it does not prove the field is empty either. On iOS and Android nothing is read back, and a widget that swallows the select-all leaves the following delete acting as a plain backspace: the field ends up ONE CHARACTER SHORTER, not unchanged, and a combined \`text\` then appends to that. Assert the value whenever the result matters. On Android levels older than \`input keycombination\` the clear deletes backwards from end-of-LINE, so a multi-line field keeps what sits below the caret; a field over 150 characters is refused rather than partly deleted. Where the length cannot be read at all — a password field, or a dump the device refused — it falls back to a fixed 128 backspaces, which is neither refusable nor exact, so a longer value keeps its head. A readonly field is refused on Chromium.
On a TV target (runtimeKind 'tv') only \`text\` applies — focus a text field first (with \`tv-remote\`), then type into it (injected HID keyboard on Apple TV, \`adb input text\` on Android TV).
Provide text OR key, never both. \`clear\` may accompany either, and always runs first: { clear: true, text: "hello" } replaces a field's value. To type and then submit, use two calls, or two \`keyboard\` steps in one \`run-sequence\`: { clear: true, text: "hello" } then { key: "enter" }.`,
