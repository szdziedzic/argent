/**
 * File-input wire contract — the INPUT-side counterpart of {@link ArtifactHandle}.
 *
 * Artifacts move files the tool-server *produced* out to the client; this
 * module's types move files the client *owns* (saved screenshots, flow YAMLs)
 * in to the tool-server. A tool that reads a caller-supplied path declares it
 * in {@link ToolDefinition.fileInputs}; the declaration is surfaced through
 * `GET /tools`, so the client knows — without tool-specific logic — which args
 * name files on *its* filesystem.
 *
 * Before sending a call, the client replaces each declared arg with a
 * {@link FileInputWire} wrapper carrying the path, its stat, and (only when the
 * client is routed to a remote tool-server) the base64 file content. The
 * tool-server resolves the wrapper back to a server-readable path *before* zod
 * validation: when the path on its own disk matches the recorded stat it is
 * used in place (co-located ⇒ zero copies, exactly mirroring the artifact
 * gate), otherwise the inlined content is materialized to a temp file. Tools
 * therefore always execute against a plain local path and stay
 * location-agnostic.
 *
 * {@link ClientFileDirective} is the reverse of an upload: a tool that needs a
 * file to land in the *client's* project (e.g. a recorded flow YAML) returns
 * the content plus the client-side destination path, and the client writes it.

 * How the server treats a declared file input:

 *                 with a clear error when neither is possible.
 * - `"directory"` — the tool reads a tree that cannot travel over the wire
 *                 (e.g. a project root). Must exist on the tool-server host;
 *                 otherwise the call fails with remote-mode guidance instead
 *                 of silently reading nothing.
 * - `"probe"`   — advisory only. The arg passes through unchanged; the tool
 *                 learns via `ctx.fileInputs` whether the path exists on the
 *                 server host and adapts (e.g. flow recording switches to
 *                 client-side persistence, screenshot-diff falls back to a
 *                 temp output dir).
 * - `"tar-upload"` — the tool reads a file or directory that the client owns
 *                 (e.g. an iOS `.app` bundle, an Android `.apk`, a Vega
 *                 `.vpkg`). Co-located: used in place when path + stat match.
 *                 Remote: the client tars the path, streams it to `POST /upload`,
 *                 sets `uploadId` and `contentHash` on the wire, and the server
 *                 always extracts from the upload (even if the path also exists
 *                 locally). Extraction lands in a hash-prefixed temp dir.
